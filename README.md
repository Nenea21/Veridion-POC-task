# Veridion-POC-task

Role outline
At Veridion, we are on a mission to shape the future of data-driven solutions. Way too many opportunities slip through the cracks because the right people donâ€™t have the right info at the right time. Weâ€™ve seen businesses go down during global shake-ups and watched great ideas stall because teams are stuck wrestling with messy, outdated data. Weâ€™re here to make data fast, smart, and actually useful.

A little bit of everything
PreSales is where you juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycleâ€¦ and somehow enjoy it. Youâ€™re right at the crossroads of three powerful worlds: tech, product, and client-facing.
Your mission is to absorb the best of each, connect the dots, and craft killer POCs that truly showcase what our data can do.
Youâ€™ve got to be a data analysis pro, not just spotting trends and patterns, but also catching the sneaky details that can make or break a POC.
You donâ€™t need to be a full-time dev, but rolling up your sleeves for some coding is key.
All of this with one goal in mind: linking a clientâ€™s pain point to how our data can actually make their lives easier and their decisions smarter.
What is a POC at Veridion?
A Proof-of-Concept is a small-scale project used to demonstrate that a solution is feasible and effective in solving a specific problem before a client commits. At Veridion, a POC usually means delivering a dataset of 1kâ€“10k companies and showing exactly how it can drive value in the prospectâ€™s day-to-day operations. Sounds simple? Itâ€™s not.

Every sample is different, our data evolves weekly, each client has unique challenges, and weâ€™re constantly crafting creative solutions or prototyping features that are still in development, or havenâ€™t even been built yet. Your mandate is to drive things from point A to point B and fully own the process and its outcome.

Cross-Functional Collaboration
Youâ€™ll work closely with Veridionâ€™s internal teams, including Technical, and Customer Success, to ensure seamless delivery of solutions that meet customer needs. Your collaborative spirit will help ensure alignment across departments, contributing to the overall success of the business.

 
Your challenge
Part 1: POC simulation
A large manufacturing companyâ€™s Procurement department is kicking off a digitalization journey. Their category managers have hit a wall â€“ they canâ€™t properly analyze spend because their supplier database is cluttered with messy, duplicate, and outdated entries. Meanwhile, leadership is pushing hard for a clear cost-saving strategy for next year. On top of that, thereâ€™s interest in exploring sustainability in the supply chain, but they just donâ€™t have the resources to prioritize it right now.

Theyâ€™re currently piloting solutions with two competitors: a well-known legacy provider and a newcomer. While theyâ€™re fairly satisfied with the newcomerâ€™s performance, the legacy playerâ€™s strong market reputation and proven value still carry weight. Budget is already allocated, and theyâ€™re set to make a decision next quarter.

1. Entity Resolution

Youâ€™ve received a sample of companies from the client for the POC. Each entry has been processed through our entity resolution engine, returning up to 5 candidate matches per row. Your task is to select the best match for each input. If none are accurate, you can leave it unmatched or find the correct entity elsewhere. The goal is to resolve every row to a real-world companyâ€”if it exists online, you should be able to find it.

2. Data analysis and QC

Once youâ€™ve picked the correct matches, review the data attributes we provide and look for any inconsistencies. You donâ€™t need to fix them (though youâ€™re free to if you want ðŸ˜„), but you should think through how to curate the dataset so itâ€™s clean and ready for the client.

3. Summarize your work

Walk us through everything you did and observed during the project. We care more about understanding your thinking process than the specific tools you used to get there.

4. Publish your work

Choose the format that you think best fits this type of challenge / use case and publish it. While solutions to all other challenges are expected to be published on github,  you can use the github field in the form below to link your work, even if it leads to a different domain other than github.

5. Submit the challenge

Next steps if you pass this round
Part 2: Roleplay Prep
Youâ€™ll need to put together a presentation for the client that highlights our value proposition and clearly walks them through the POC results.

Part 3: In-Person interview
Youâ€™ll have 30 minutes during the in-person interview to present your deck â€“ weâ€™ll play the role of the client. After that, thereâ€™ll be a 1-hour live task to give you a better feel for the kind of work a PreSales Data Specialist handles.
